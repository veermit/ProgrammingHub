L&T:
1) Project explanantion.
2) What is void pointer.
  assign an integer address to void pointer and print it.
3) How can you access the structure pointer memeber variable.
  struct st
  {
    int a;
    int *b;
  };
  Ans: struct st sVar;
      
      sVar.a;
      int a = 5;
      sVar.b = (int *) calloc(1, sizeof(int));
      printf("%d\n",*(sVar.b));
      
      struct st *sVar = (struct st*)calloc(1,sizeof(struct st));
      sVar->a;
      sVar->b = (int *) calloc (1,sizeof(int));
